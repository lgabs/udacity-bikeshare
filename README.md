# Exploring Shared Bikes Data

Recently, systems of shared bikes are growing in number and popularity, especially taking into account the ecological benefits of this transportation. In this business, people usually pay to use one or more shared bikes for a determined time, may it be some hours or a month, taking a bike in some point A and returning it in point B (which can be point A).
Hence, one bike can serve a lot of clients in a day, and the configuration of bikes along their stations can be very different everyday. The technology allows a very simple way of accessing these bikes, and bring with it a lot of information that can be used to explore the way people use the system. 

In this project (project 1 of the Udacity's Data Science 1 Nanodegree), we analyze data given by an american company of shared bikes in Chicago to get some insights such as most used routes, usage by day of the week and distribution of the age of users.
